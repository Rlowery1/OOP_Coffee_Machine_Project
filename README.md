# OOP_Coffee_Machine_Project
OOP version of the Coffee Machine Project
The main.py file is the only file that needs to be referrenced. The other files are supplementary to what is located on the main.py file. 
Use the other files for importing whats located onto the main file. 
Project shows how I was able to use different classes, create objects from those classes and use methods/attributes associated with those methods.
The end result is a simple coffe machine project

"off" to turn machine off
"report" to print a report of resources that are available and how much profit has been made from the purchase of drinks.
